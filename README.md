This solution demonstrates my implementation of the repository pattern, in C#.
In this implementation, I am using Entity Framework code-first approach,
LocalDb, LINQ and Fluent Validation. I keep inversion of control in mind
throughout the solution. I use a service layer as well as a unit of work
object.

The ASP.NET MVC4 project demonstrates usage of view models, inversion of
control, dependency injection and finally a basic method of localization.
